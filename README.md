# Hi there, I'm Juan Felipe ðŸ‘‹

I am a backend developer specializing in Python, with a focus on Django and Django Rest Framework. I have solid experience in using ORM for efficient object-relational mapping and building scalable APIs.

I utilize Docker and docker-compose to efficiently manage multiple containers. Additionally, I use Traefik for traffic control and SSL, and I am proficient with Cookiecutter Django for quickly and effectively starting new projects.

My testing approach includes pytest, supported by Factory Boy to create comprehensive and consistent unit tests. Factory Boy is essential for generating realistic and repeatable test data, enhancing test reliability.

I use Git for version control and GitHub Projects to track issues and organize tasks. Additionally, I leverage GitHub Actions to set up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines, ensuring an agile and efficient development cycle.

On the frontend, I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and frameworks like React. I utilize Bootstrap5, Tailwind, Tanstack Query for data fetching and state management, and Tanstack Router for routing.

I am always seeking continuous improvement and have a strong sense of responsibility for the tasks I commit to.
